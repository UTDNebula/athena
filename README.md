## About

### Overview

UTD-Trends offers students and faculty an accessible and easily digestible means
of viewing the data stored in the Nebula API. This front-end for the API offers
data visualization tools so that students can view agregated data and make more informed
decisions on their coursework.

### Inspiration

For years the students of UTD have made use of the UTD Grades tool to access
information about their coursework in conjunction with other web applications like
Rate My Professor.

Now Project Nebula hopes to offer students a comprehensive view of course information
all in a single application through UTD-Trends. The hope is to offer students an all
in one experience and streamline the data gathering experience of students while providing
better data gathered through UTD specific sources rather than the crowd sourcing of other sites.

UTD-Trends hopes to offer more tooling to students than previously available and build upon the
successes of UTD Grades to enhance the student experience.

### Features

- Data Visualizations for the Nebula API
- Easy searchability and result filtering
- Section comparison
- Multi-metric evaluations on course performance
